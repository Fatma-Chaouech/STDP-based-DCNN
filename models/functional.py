    It returns a list of winners, each in a tuple of form (feature, row, column).

    .. note::

        Winners are selected sequentially. Each winner inhibits surrounding neruons in a specific radius in all of the
        other feature maps. Note that only one winner can be selected from each feature map.

    Args:
        potentials (Tensor): The tensor of input potentials.
        kwta (int, optional): The number of winners. Default: 1
        inhibition_radius (int, optional): The radius of lateral inhibition. Default: 0
        spikes (Tensor, optional): Spike-wave corresponding to the input potentials. Default: None

    Returns:
        List: List of winners.
